# Rheanne Reyes - React Portfolio

This is a responsive portfolio made using React. Each page has an animated hero header and a footer including links to my LinkedIn, Github, downloadable resume, and opens up a new email to me. The Home/'About Me' page has a short bio. The 'Portfolio' page features some of my work and group projects. The 'Contact Me' page includes a form for users to contact me personally.
